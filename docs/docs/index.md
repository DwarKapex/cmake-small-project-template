# CMake Small Project Template

Welcome to the documentation for CMake Project Template

This is my personal vision of how small C++ project should be organized
in terms of folder structure for better readability and intuitive 

There are no new abstractions, pure cmake and wrappers around some functions.

If you're reading this, that means that you've cloned the repo successfully. Hooray! As this repo
works with cmake, you need to install it. Please follow this [instruction](https://cmake.org/install/) to 
accomplish this simple task. Note that this repo is for CMake version 3.15 or higher.

I use *googletest* as a unit test framework, so if you want to run unit-tests, please clone it as well:

```bash
$> cd <path/to/folder/>/cmake-small-project-template
$> 
```
